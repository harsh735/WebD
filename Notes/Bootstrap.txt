*************NAVBARS**********************

Created using a <nav> tag. We give classes to the different types of navbars present and accordingly adjust/style our webpage. 

for eg: <nav class="navbar navbar-default">
		<div class="navbar-header">
		</div
	</nav>




1)It is preferred to put the contents in a container (<div class="container">) so that it takes up spacing and our content looks neat. Don't put the navbar inside a container because then our navbar will be limited to the space of the container itself. 

Tip: Try to put your text/content inside a container after declaring a navbar.


2)Hamburger button: 
The thing thats the most important is the "data-target" attribute. Whatever this is set to , we have to change our corresponding ID and then our content will collapse and open up. 

If we change the data-target attribute , we must change the ID as well but we should not add the "#" because it is self defined. 






**************THE GRID SYSTEM*********************

1)The grid is always placed inside a container. 
We can only make changes upto 12 columns. Meaning that on our webpage there are only 12 columns which we can use. 

Syntax: 
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4">TEXT HERE</div>
	</div>


There are a lot of sizes with which we can work with, they are:

xl - extra large (newer bootstrap syntax- "col-xl-")
lg - large
sm - small
md - medium
xs - extra small (newer bootstrap syntax- "col-")
