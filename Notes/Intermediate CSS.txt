*************FONTS********************

1)We change the font by using the font-family: property.
If the font begins with a number we use " " to enter our font in.


2)We change the size of the font by using the font-size: property.
We can use pixels(px) , em(relative font size)


3)em is basically used to dynamically change our font size. It is relative to the parent element under which our text is in. 

for eg:

<p>
abcd hello <span>what</span> a beautiful day!
</p>

and then in our css file we go:

span {
	font-size: 2.0em;
}

so it will make the word "what" twice the size of the other words that are under the paragraph or <p> tag.



4)Font weight:
Refers to how thick the lines are of the font. for eg bold, regular,italics etc.
It varies from 100-800.


5) Important properties:
line height, text align , text decoration.







*****************BOX MODEL************************


Consists of 4 important properties:

Content, Padding, Border and Margin. We can play around with these properties in order to give our content a more finished look.

In chrome:
Blue = content
Green = padding
Orange = margin

We can use the property margin: top right bottom left;

to give 4 separate margins to our content in just one line.

To center an element, we can use the 

margin: 0 auto  0 auto 0 auto 0 auto; 
to centrally align our text.
