2 types of elements: block line and inline . Block line get their own line whereas inline elements continue in 1 line only.

<strong> - for bold text
<em> - emphasis, for italics text 

**********LISTS***************

Theres 2 types of lists ordered and unordered. 

<ol> - for ordered list , gives the content in numbers]
<ul> - for unordered list, uses bullet points for content


After writing the <ol> or <ul> tag you must add some list items or <li> tag to it.Both of them require list items. 


eg:  <ol>
   	<li>
  		content
	</li>
     </ol>




*******************CONTAINERS*****************************

<div> is a block level container, it helps in grouping a bunch of text together in a form of container.So basically it takes up its own line, similar to <p> tag.


<span> is also a container , but unlike <div> it is an inline container. 




********************ATTIRIBUTES***************************

Attributes are a way through which we add additional information to our html document. 

they are of the format:  some word = something in text.

many attributes only work on 2-5 different elements , some of them only work on 1. 


Attributes important for now: src and href.


1)To add an image: <img src= "image_name.png">
it is a self closing tag.


2)To add links to your file , use the anchor tag or the
  <a> tag.

Syntax:   <a href="url">Link Text</a>




*************HTML TABLES************************

To add a table in your html document, you use the

<table> tag , followed by <tr> tag and then <td> tag




syntax :    <table>
		<tr>
			<td> Text </td>
		</tr>
	    </table


2)To add a heading to your table , use the <th> tag. 

eg:   <table border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Name</th>
	</tr>
      </table>



In order to minimize complexity , we can add 2 tags,

<thead> and <tbody> . the <thead> to put all the headings inside of it and the actual content of the table inside the <tbody> tag



 

***********************FORMS IN HTML********************************

Important tags: <form> tag
		<label> tag
		<input> tag




1)<form> tag 

takes 2 attributes , action and method

action -  uses the url to send form data to (where to send the data)
method -  it is the type of HTTP request. (eg: get,post etc)

until our backend is covered , we can't do anything with our forms.



syntax for using <form> tag:

<form action="/my-form-submission-page" method = "post">
</form>




2) <input> tag is what goes inside our forms.

syntax: 

<input type="text">
<input type="date">
<input type="color">
<input type="file">
<input type="checkbox"> 

here type is an attribute.




in the input tab , you can add a placeholder which basically tells the user what to put inside the form.


Form is just a container where we enter our inputs. 
It is a block level element.




*********************LABELS******************

They let us add captions to individual elements in our forms.
They are really important for making our site visible


syntax:  

<form action="http://xyz.com" method="post">
	<label for="username">Username:</label>
	<input id="username" type="text">
	<label for="password">Password:</label>
	<input id="password" type="password">
	<input type="submit"> or <button>Submit</button>

We can use attributes such as "for" and "id" in our label tag




***********FORM VALIDATIONS************************

We can put simple validations such as the 
required attribute to make sure that an input is not empty.

There are also type validators. For eg we can put "email" validator 
instead of text validator.






***********DROPDOWNS AND RADIO BUTTONS**********************


<select> tag is used to create nice dropdown menus.
we need to use the <option> tag in order to get choices for our dropdown menu.

syntax: 

<select name="abc">
	<option>Red</option>
	<option>Yellow</option>
</select>




we can use the <textarea> tag in order to get a large text space for adding bios and stuff and we can specify the size for the same by using the rows and cols attributes.
