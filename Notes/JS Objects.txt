************************JS OBJECTS************************

It is similar to classes or structures in c++. 
For eg: 

var person = {
	name: "harsh",
	age: 20,
	city: "gurgaon"
};

Here we can access the name age and city of the person easily. It is a list so we must put a "," at the end of our array item.Unlike arrays, objects have no order.


The data can be retrieved using bracket or "." operator

for eg:	console.log(variableName.property);
	console.log(person.name);



We can add functions inside of an object. That is then referred to as a METHOD.For eg: console.log()
